# CS 381 - Game Engine Architecture

My project implementations for CS 381 at UNR, Spring 2019.

### Getting Started

* All projects were run on Linux Mint 18.3 with an i5-7300HQ and GTX 1050 Mobile (proprietary drivers, 384.130)
* Eclipse 3.8 was used to manage the projects, along with Ogre 1.9
* The includes I used for Eclipse can be found in /resources/MyOgreIncludes.txt
* An install script is also provided to install dependencies

## Running the programs
After creating a new C/C++ project in Eclipse and copying the includes (changing as necessary for your system), simply copy the /src and /inc folders of the assignment into the project, as well as "plugins.cfg" and "resources.cfg". Please note that assignment 3 onwards requires the data found in 381.zip found in /resources and needs the path in "resources.cfg" to be updated.
